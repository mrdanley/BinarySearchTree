# BinarySearchTree

#Small project for understanding the structure and application of a binary search tree. Program is implemented specifically for integer input and contains these functions:
#a. Build a binary search tree using integer values in the order they are entered.
#b. Print 3 traversals: pre-, in-, and post-order.
#c. Allow the user to insert/delete a value. Once a new tree is generated, print it in-order.
#d. Find predecessor of a given value.
#e. Find successor of a given value. 
#Notes: Add and delete methods are implemented using recursion; no duplicate values allowed.
